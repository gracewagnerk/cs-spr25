    <p>D. Christopher Wagner is President and Lead Carpenter for Forest Park Builders, Inc. Chris started the business
      in October of 1991.</p>
    <p>He is responsible for all marketing, competitive bidding, material procurement and hiring for all subcontractor
      project engagements. Chris is also responsible for scheduling and project accounting.
      Forest Park Builders, Inc. started with a mission statement, "Your Project is our Priority", for a truly customer
      relationship focused business. Starting with small intimate customer projects like basic home repairs, bathrooms
      and decks, Chris continued to grow the business towards larger scope projects including kitchens, whole house
      remodels and additions. New custom homes became something Chris was asked to provide by prior clients as his trust
      was intimate and proven. Large commercial projects were brought into the business model and several years of
      building Dale Chihuly's production and personal buildings brought new skillsets to the business. Forest Park
      Builders, Inc. today is a solely referral based business.</p>
    <p>Chris attended Western Washington University and graduated from the School of Business in 1989 with a double
      major in Finance and Marketing. Chris is long time resident of Lake Forest Park and currently resides in a custom
      home he built for his family in 2004. Chris is an avid skier with his family and also enjoys playing ice hockey
      for the
      past 53 years. Chris has also volunteered and headed the Watch Dog Dads program in his kids grade school, coached
      baseball, softball, basketball and was Vice President for the Aqua Club Swim & Tennis facility.
      Chris has been married for 23 years and has two college age children.</p>
