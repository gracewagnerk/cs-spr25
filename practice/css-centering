  <h1>CSS Centering</h1>
  <h2>Inline element example</h2>
  <p><span>center me inline</span></p>
  <p>Do not center with the html deprecated element <pre><center></pre></p>
  <p>Flexbox is <em>very</em> helpful in alignment but there are times you need something else.</p>
  <p>You would think centering would be easy and sensible since it is such a common thing in websites, alas, it can be a bit tricky and not intuitive, at least to me</p>
  <p>There is a guide at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/">css tricks</a> that is as helpful as I have found.</p>
